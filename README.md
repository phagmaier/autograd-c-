# AUTOGRAD
## SUMMARY:
Automatic differentiation using c++. Was supposed to be the start of an entire c++ machine learning library but pytorch already works with c++ and will most likley be better than whatever I could create plus the majority of operations involve matrix multiplication and I don't really want to grind on a a matmul algo that's faster than pytorch since to do that I would have to work at a lower level than I am comfortable/capable of doing at the moment I'll probably just stop here and leave this up for "educational purposes".
