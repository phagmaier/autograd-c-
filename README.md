# AUTOGRAD
## SUMMARY:
Automatic differentiation using c++. Was supposed to be the start of an entire c++ machine learning library but pytorch already has compatability with c++ and since the majority of the time spent in machine learning is doing matrix multiplication and I don't really want to grind on a a threaded matmul algo that's faster than pytorch this is probably all I'll do.
